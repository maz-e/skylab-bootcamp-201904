# Bingo

Bingo is a game of chance that consists of a drum with a certain number of balls numbered inside. Players play with cards with random numbers written on them, within the corresponding range. An announcer is taking balls out of the bass drum, announcing the numbers out loud. If a player has that number on his card, he crosses it out, and the game continues like this until someone manages to mark all the numbers on his card.
