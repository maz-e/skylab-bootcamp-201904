            <p>Skylab was the first United States space station launched and operated by NASA,[2] and occupied for about 24 weeks between May 1973 and February 1974 â€“ the only space station the U.S. has operated exclusively. In 1979 it fell back to Earth amid huge worldwide media attention. Skylab included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems necessary for crew survival and scientific experiments.</p>
